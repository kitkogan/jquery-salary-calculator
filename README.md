## Description

For this project, we were asked to create a user input form to get employee information, perform a calculation of monthly costs, and append the user info and monthly costs to the DOM using jQuery. This involved several different steps in order to create specified user input fields, capture user input info, and manipulate the information as outlined in the project instructions. The user form was created in HTML, but the submit button then appends the user info to the DOM dynamically. A 'remove employee informaton' button also appears dynamically next to each respective user. The functunality is super close to working as intended, however the app still re-adds deleted users when new users are added. I would like to revisit this and fix that at some point in the near future.
